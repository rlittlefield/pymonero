This is an implementation of the JH hash function in Python.

It is designed as a reference implementation, with almost no concessions
made for speed besides memoization of a few functions. As a result I
discovered an error in the original JH spec/implementation which has since
been corrected. Run "jhtest" to test the implementation against the JH test
vectors.
